# MediaGrade ALPHA
CS50x Final Project

This is an education web application.

Created to facilitate assessement of media projects as photo, video or audio files
it is optimized for the belgian hight-school assessment system but it is intended to be internationalized as much as possible . 

Students can upload requested projects, access instructions, get assessement and view others projects submissions.
Further features will show up as it still Work in Progress...

Please forgive english approximation I used declaring variables.
