# MediaGrade BETA

This is an educational web application.

Specifically created to facilitate the assessment of multimedia students' projects (as photo, video and audio files), this application is designed to suit the belgian high-school system.

I am a Belgian teacher of video and photo production and I wanted to create a platform to ease both teacher and student experience.

Teachers can assess, comment student's work, manage projects, download vote grids and generate assessment sheets.

Students can upload requested projects, access instructions, get assessment details and view others' subbmitted projects.

Further features will show up in the future.

Previews:
