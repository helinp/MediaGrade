# MediaGrade BETA
**CS50x 2015 Final Project**

This is an education web application.

Created to facilitate assessement of media projects as photo, video or audio files
this application is optimized for the belgian high-school assessment system but it is intended to be internationalized as much as possible. 

As a belgian teacher of video and photo production, I wanted to set up a platform to enhance teacher - students and to ease rating of submitted work, add some statistics, facilitate self assessment and exibit students work.

Students can upload requested projects, access instructions, get assessement and view others projects submissions.
Further features will show up as it still a Work in Progress...
